As of August 29th, Google has met with an AI startup in India
intending to use "bioacoustics" to detect and diagnose early signs
of disease, all based on a quick 10-second audio sample. The startup
(Salicit Technologies) has an app called "Swaasa" (named after the
Sanskrit word for "breath") that tests for diseases "with a 94%
accuracy." The app will hopefully be able to detect early signs of
tuberculosis (TB), a highly contagious, deadly disease, but one that
is easily treatable. Google has trained its AI model on publically
accessible audio clips from sources such as YouTube. Currently,
"4,500 people die daily" due to TB, simply due to lack of diagnoses.
If Swaasa continues to be successful and is accepted by healthcare
professionals, it could cause thousands of lives to be saved every day.
