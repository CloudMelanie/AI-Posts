Researchers have determined that approximately 57% of all "web-based text"
have been translated. However, these translations have been inaccurate and
overall very poorly done. This suggests that the translations were performed
by AI. The decrease in quality is a result of something called "model collapse".
Essentially, generative AI produces data, and when it is trained on that data,
it produces less accurate data as a result. The cycle repeats until the AI is
returning something nearly intelligible. This is a problem, because an AI expert
predicts that by 2025, nearly 90% of content on the internet will be AI generated.
